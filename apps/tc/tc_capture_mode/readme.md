# TC capture mode

This example application shows how to use the TC module in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of an external input.

## Description

The TC channel is configured in capture mode to measure duty cycle and frequency of the PWM signal. The PWM signal is generated using another TC channel which is configured in compare mode. Output of the compare TC channel is connected to input of the capture TC channel.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Setting up the board

- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Use a jumper wire to connect J8-PIN8 to J22-PIN6

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
3. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
4. Console displays frequency and duty cycle of input signal as shown below
