# PIO polling

This example application shows how to poll the switch input, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

## Description

This application uses the PIO Peripheral library to read GPIO pin connected to the switch, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate switch status. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released.

## Downloading and building the application

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d27_som1_ek.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

### Setting up [SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/atsama5d27-som1-ek1)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d27_som1_ek.X/binaries/boot.bin)

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the switch is released

Following table provides details of switch and LED:

| Board      | Switch Name |  LED Name |
