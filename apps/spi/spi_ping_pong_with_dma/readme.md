# SPI ping pong with DMA

This example application shows how to continuously transmit and receive data over a SPI interface using ping pong buffers with the DMA.

## Description

DMA peripheral provides support to implement ping-pong buffering. DMA transmits and receives data from one pair of buffers, when CPU works on the second pair.

When DMA is transmitting data from ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate transfer completion from ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to transmit data from pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer.

When DMA is receiving data to ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate the availability of data in the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to receive data in the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer.

Data is transmitted and received in loopback mode by shorting the MISO and MOSI lines. At the end of transfer, received data is compared with transmitted data to confirm data match.

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/at91bootstrap/blob/master/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Use a jumper wire to short pin 4 and pin 5 of the J20 connector

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Reset the board to run the application
5. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
