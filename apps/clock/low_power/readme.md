### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/at91bootstrap/blob/master/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the USB port J22 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to enable debug com port)
- Connect the USB port J7 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
5. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
6. Reset the board to run the application
7. Press '0' in the terminal window
    - Observe the message "Entering Idle Mode for 30 seconds" in the terminal window
    - Wait for 30 seconds and observe the message "Leaving Idle Mode" in the terminal window
8. Press '1' in the terminal window
    - Observe the message "Entering ULP0 Mode for 30 seconds" in the terminal window
    - Wait for 30 seconds and observe the message "Leaving ULP0 Mode" in the terminal window.
