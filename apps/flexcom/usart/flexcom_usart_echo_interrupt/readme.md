# FLEXCOM USART interrupt

This example application shows how to use the flexcom module in USART mode.

## Description

This application configures the flexcom peripheral in USART mode and performs read and write operation in a non-blocking manner. The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters from the terminal window and echoes them back.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/flexcom/usart/flexcom_usart_echo_interrupt/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the SD Card

- Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](firmware/at91bootstrap_sam_a5d2_xult.X/binaries/boot.bin)
- Copy the downloaded boot loader binary( boot.bin) onto the SD card

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC1
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra board as per below Pin Connections

    | SAM A5D2 Xplained Ultra board Pins | [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) Pins |
    | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
    | F0_TXD, J22 connector | RX |
    | F0_RXD, J22 connector | TX |
    | PIN 20, XPRO EXT2 connector | 3.3V |
    | PIN 19, XPRO EXT2 connector | GND |

- Connect the Mini USB connector on the [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to the computer using a Mini USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Copy the output binary (named 'harmony.bin') onto the SD Card (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section above for setting up the SD card)
3. Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board (Refer to the 'Setting up hardware' section for the correct SDMMC slot)
4. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
5. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
6. Reset the board to run the application
7. The console displays the following message

    ![output](images/output_flexcom_usart_echo_blocking.png)

8. Type 10 characters
9. Entered characters will be echoed back and the LED is toggled
10. The following table provides the LED names

    | Board      | LED Name                                    |
