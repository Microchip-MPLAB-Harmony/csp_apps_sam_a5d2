# FLEXCOM TWI (I2C) EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the flexcom module in TWI mode.

## Description

This application configures the flexcom peripheral in TWI mode to read and write data from an external EEPROM memory chip. Data is written to the EEPROM and then read back and compared. Successful comparison is indicated by turning on an LED.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/flexcom/twi/master/flexcom_twi_eeprom/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting up [SAMA5D2 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATSAMA5D2C-XULT)

#### Addtional hardware required

- [EEPROM 3 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click)

#### Setting up the board

- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
- Connect EEPROM Click 3 Board to XPRO EXT2 (J26) connector on the board as per below Pin Connections table

| XPRO EXT2 (J26) Pins | EEPROM 4 CLICK Pins |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| PIN 11 | SDA |
| PIN 12 | SCL |
| PIN 19 | GND |
| PIN 20 | 3V3 |
|||

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name                                    |
