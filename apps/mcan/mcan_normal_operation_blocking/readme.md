# MCAN blocking

This example application shows how to use the MCAN module to transmit and receive CAN messages in polling mode.

## Description

This application transmits and receives CAN messages on the CAN bus.  To run this application, an evaluation board and [Microchip CAN Bus Analyzer](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/APGDT002) is required . They act as different nodes on the CAN bus. While running the application, user can send and receive CAN messages between the board and the analyzer.

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/mcan/mcan_normal_operation_blocking/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

    | ------------ | ------------------- |
    | CANTX0 (PIN8), J9 Connector | RX (PIN 14) |
    | CANRX0 (PIN7), J9 Connector | TX (PIN 13) |
    | 3V3 (PIN20), EXT1 Connector | 3V3 (PIN 7) |
    | VDD_5V (PIN3), J24 Connector | 5V (PIN 10) |
    | GND (PIN19), EXT1 Connector | GND (PIN 9) |
    |||

- Connect [Microchip CAN Bus Analyzer](http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/APGDT002) to PC using USB Male-A to Male Mini-B cable
- Short jumper JP2 (DEBUG_DIS)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer.
3. Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
4. Open the CAN Analyzer Software and perform following steps
    - Configure CAN Analyzer Software as per Hardware Setup mention in below screenshot

    ![output_1](images/output_mcan_normal_operation_blocking_1.png)

    - Send CAN message from CAN Analyzer Software

5. Received message will be echoed back to the CAN analyzer software and terminal window
6. Following will be terminal sessionâ€™s output
