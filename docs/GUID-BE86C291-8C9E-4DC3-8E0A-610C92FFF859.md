# UART Echo Interrupt

This example application shows how to use the UART peripheral to transfer a block of data<br /> in a non-blocking manner.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example shows the read and write operation over a UART in a non-blocking manner.<br /> The peripheral interrupt is used to manage the transfer. It receives 10 characters<br /> from the terminal window and echoes them back.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board Kit

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect UART Debug port on the board to the computer using a FTDI USB cable

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  In console window, type 10 characters
5.  Entered characters will be echoed back and the LED is toggled

Refer to the following table for LED name:
