# PIO Interrupt

This example application shows how to generate GPIO interrupt on switch press and<br /> release, and indicate the switch status using the LED.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This application uses the PIO Peripheral library to generate callback on switch press<br /> and release, and drives the GPIO pin connected to the LED to indicate the switch<br /> status. The LED is turned ON when the switch is pressed and turned OFF when the<br /> switch is released.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.
