# ADC Polling

This example application shows how to sample an analog input in polled mode and send the<br /> converted data to console.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

In this example, Analog input voltage in the range of 0V to 3.3V is fed to the ADC<br /> and converted value is displayed on the console. The ADC conversion is triggered by<br /> software and result is polled using status API.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the UART Debug port \(J28\) on the board to the computer using a FTDI USB to serial cable.
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable \(to power the board\)
-   Use a jumper wire to connect Pin 1 of mikroBUS1 J19 \(AD6 is used for input and is mapped to Port Pin PD25\) to 3.3 V or GND

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  Console displays ADC Count and ADC Input Voltage
