# FLEXCOM USART Blocking

This example application shows how to use the FLEXCOM module in USART mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This application configures the FLEXCOM peripheral in USART mode and performs read<br /> and write operation in a blocking manner. The CPU polls the peripheral register<br /> continuously to manage the transfer. It receives a line of characters from the<br /> terminal window and echoes them back.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

    |--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |PIN 5, J8<br /> connector|RX|
    |PIN 4, J8<br /> connector|TX|
    |PIN 7, mikroBUS1<br /> connector|3.3V|
    |PIN 1, J8<br /> connector|GND|

-   Connect the Mini USB connector on the [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to the computer using a Mini USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  The console displays the following message

    ![](GUID-78808485-4055-41C2-987B-BB16C93F1E51-low.png)

5.  Type a line of characters and press the Enter key

    **Note:** *Number of characters entered before pressing enter key must be less than 256.*

6.  Entered line will be echoed back and the LED is toggled

The following table provides the LED name:
