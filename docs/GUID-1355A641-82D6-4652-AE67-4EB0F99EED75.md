# TC Compare Mode

This example application shows how to use the TC module in compare mode to generate an<br /> active low, active high, and toggle output on compare match.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

Three TC channels are configured in compare mode. Each channel generates different<br /> output waveform depending upon configured action on compare match and period<br /> match.

**Active low output**: Output is set high on compare match A and is set low on<br /> compare match C.

**Active high output**: Output is set low on compare match A and is set high on<br /> compare match C.

**Toggle output**: Output toggles on compare match A.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.
