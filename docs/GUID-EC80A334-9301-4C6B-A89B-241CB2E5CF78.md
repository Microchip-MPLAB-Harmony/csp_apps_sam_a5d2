# QSPI Flash Read Write

This example application shows how to use the QSPI Peripheral library to perform erase,<br /> write and read operation with the QSPI Serial Flash memory in Quad IO mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example uses the QSPI peripheral library to erase and write an array of values<br /> to the QSPI Serial Flash memory. It verifies the value written by reading the values<br /> back and comparing it to the value written.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  LED indicates success or failure:
    -   The LED is toggled when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash memory matched with the written value
    -   The LED is turned ON when the value read from the QSPI Serial Flash did not match with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:

|Board|LED Name|
