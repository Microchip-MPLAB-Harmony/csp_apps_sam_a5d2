# TWIHS EEPROM Read Write

This example application shows how to use the TWIHS peripheral to write and read from the<br /> I2C serial EEPROM memory.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example uses the TWIHS peripheral library to write an array of values to the I2C<br /> Serial EEPROM and verify the value written by reading the values back and comparing<br /> it to the value written.

## Downloading and Building the Application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then<br /> click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

## Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDITIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware are required:
    -   [EEPROM 3 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click)

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable
-   Connect EEPROM Click 3 Board to XPRO EXT2 \(J19\) connector on the board as per below Pin Connections table
-   |J19 MikroBus1<br /> Pins|EEPROM 3 CLICK<br /> Pins|
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|PIN 11 \(PD4\)|SDA|
|PIN 12 \(PD5\)|SCL|
|PIN 19|GND|
|PIN 20|3V3|


## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  The LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   The LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    -   The LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:
