# Building AT91Bootstrap Project Using MPLABx

-   Open a console and execute the following command to clone at91bootstrap repository into a directory named at91bootstrap.X

    ``` {#CODEBLOCK_GPF_NRT_HZB}
     git clone https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap at91bootstrap.X
    ```

-   Open at91bootstrap.X directory as project in MPLABx

## Configure Compiler

-   Open project properties window, and choose â€œMakefileâ€? option to configure the compiler:

**Note:** *For the build to be successful, the configured compiler should be available in the system path.*

## Configure Target

-   Open project properties window, and choose â€œKconfigâ€? option to configure the build target:

-   Click on â€œLOADâ€? button and navigate to the configs folder inside at91bootstrap.X directory. You need to choose the default configuration file\(defconfig\) based on what you need the at91boostrap to do

    **Debug/Run application from within MPLABx**

    -   Load *\{evaluation\_kit\}\_bkpt\_none\_defconfig*. For example, on SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board, select **sama5d2\_curiosity\_bkptnone\_defconfig** as the configuration file
    -   Click on â€œApplyâ€? and â€œOKâ€? buttons to configure the project

        ![](GUID-50F03417-3F5E-43ED-BE75-17098B48B0A2-low.png)

    -   You can see that the MPU product is now selected as â€œSAMA5D2â€? and the primary operation is selected as â€œConfigure and Stopâ€?
    **Load and Run application from an SD card**

    -   Load *\{evaluation\_kit\}sd\_uboot\_defconfig*. For example, on SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board, select **sama5d29\_curiositysd\_uboot\_defconfig** as the configuration file
    -   Click on â€œApplyâ€? and â€œOKâ€? buttons to configure the project

        ![](GUID-F47A8608-0AC3-4D0B-AD05-A867A86CD87C-low.png)

    -   You can see that the MPU product is now selected as â€œSAMA5D2â€? and the primary operation is selected as â€œLoad and launch next softwareâ€?
    -   Edit the Option â€œNext Software Image File Nameâ€? from *u-boot.bin* to *harmony.bin*

## Build Target

Once the target configuration is applied in the properties window, you can build the<br /> at91boostrap just like any other MPLABx project. After the build is complete, you<br /> can find the generated binary files under build/binaries directory.
