    "content": "This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. Application uses USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. Applcation registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. It then transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA readis complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Application calls DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. Application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads updated values in the main memory into the read buffer (and into the cache memory). Cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), thus the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. This is the reason why 32 byte buffers are used for receiving and echoing 10 bytes of data. ",

DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to transmit data from pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. When DMA is receiving data to ping buffer, CPU works on pong buffer. When DMA completes transfer, it generates an interrupt to indicate the availability of data in the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to receive data in the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. Data is transmitted and received in loopback mode by shorting the MISO and MOSI lines. At the end of transfer, received data is compared with transmitted data to confirm data match. ",

This project is adapted to be used from within MPLABx IDE on both Windows and Linux. To facilitate the debugging and running of the MPU application, each application in this repository is bundled with its own copy of the AT91Bootstrap project. Each copy of the bootstrap project can be found under same folder as the application project and is named and is prefixed with “at91bootstrap_”. For eg: if the application folder name is sam_9x60_ek.X, then bootstrap project folder will be named at91bootstrap_sam_9x60_ek.X and will be present at the same folder level. Bootstrap project is configured to load and execute a raw binary file named “harmony.bin” from the SD card. SD card slot to be used shall vary with the evaluation kit. Each application project is configured with a post build step which will generate the necessary binary file named “harmony.bin” at the end of each build. If you are only interested in running or debugging the MPU applications in this repository , you can skip the following sections and and jump straight to Debugging MPU application using MPLABx.
