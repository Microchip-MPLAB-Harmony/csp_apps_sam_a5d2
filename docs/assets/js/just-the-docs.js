This Agreement automatically terminates immediately if Licensee violates the restrictions set forth in Sections 1, 2 or 4(a). Microchip may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice if (a) Licensee or its affiliates become competitors of Microchip, or (b) Licensee breaches any other term of this Agreement and does not cure such breach within 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach from Microchip. Upon termination of this Agreement, (i) the license grants in Sections 1 and 2(b) terminate, and (ii) Licensee will return to Microchip or destroy (and certify the destruction of) all Microchip Property and Confidential Information in its possession or under its control, and all copies thereof. The following sections survive termination of this Agreement: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. 8. Dangerous Applications. The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring failsafe performance (\\\"Dangerous Applications\\\"). Dangerous Applications include the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, weapons systems, or any environment or system in which the failure of the Software could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. Microchip specifically disclaims (a) any express or implied warranty of fitness for use of the Software in Dangerous Applications; and (b) any and all liability for loss, damages and claims resulting from the use of the Software in Dangerous Applications. 9. EU Consumers - Applicable Terms. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS APPLY INSTEAD OF SECTIONS 9 AND 10 BELOW: Microchip and its licensors will not be liable (a) for any loss suffered by Licensee in connection with the Software where such loss was not reasonably foreseeable when the Software was first downloaded by Licensee, even if such loss was the result of negligence or the failure of Microchip and its licensors to comply with this Agreement; or (b) irrespective of the basis of claim, for any loss of revenue, profit or other business or economic loss suffered. Some Software is made available to Licensee free of charge, and Licensee may at any time download further copies without charge to replace the Software initially downloaded and others may require a fee to be downloaded, or to download any further copies. In all circumstances, to the extent liability may lawfully be limited or excluded, the cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors will not exceed USD$1,000 (or equivalent sum in the currency of the country in which Licensee resides). However, none of the foregoing limits or excludes any liability for death or personal injury arising from negligence, or for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other cause that by law cannot be excluded and limited. 10. Warranty Disclaimers. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED ON AN \\\"AS-IS\\\" BASIS. MICROCHIP MAKES NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STAUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, IF PROVIDED, WILL NOT EXPAND THESE WARRANTIES. IF CUSTOMER IS A CONSUMER, THE ABOVE WILL NOT ACT TO EXCLUDE YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS. 11. Limited Liability. EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 8 APPLIES, IN NO EVENT WILL MICROCHIP BE LIABLE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, INDEMNITY, CONTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS, DAMAGE, COST OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, HOWEVER CAUSED, OR ANY LOSS OF PRODUCTION, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF USE OR LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF MICROCHIP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. MICROCHIP'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED USD$1,000. 12. General. (a) This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Arizona and the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions. The parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts in Maricopa County, Arizona for any dispute relating to this Agreement. WHERE LICENSEE IS A CONSUMER LOCATED IN EUROPE, this Agreement is subject to the laws of the country in which the Software is downloaded, and, to the extent so mandated by such laws, subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that country. The parties expressly disclaim the applicability of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods in connection with this Agreement. (b) Unless the parties have a mutually executed agreement relating to the licensing of this Software by Microchip to Licensee (\\\"Signed Agreement\\\"), this Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Software, and supersedes and replaces prior or contemporaneous written or verbal agreements or communications between the parties regarding the Software, including any purchase orders. If the parties have a Signed Agreement, this Agreement does not supersede or replace that Signed Agreement. This Agreement will not be modified except by a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Microchip. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement constitutes a waiver of any prior, concurrent, or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions of this Agreement, and no waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. (c) Licensee agrees to comply with all import and export laws and restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce or other United States or foreign agency or authority. (d) This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Licensee may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part, whether by law or otherwise, without Microchip's prior written consent. Any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, reorganization, transfer of all or substantially all assets or other change in control or majority ownership (\\\"Change of Control\\\") is considered an assignment for the purpose of this Section. Any attempt to assign this Agreement without such consent will be null and void. However, Microchip may assign this Agreement to an affiliate, or to another entity in the event of a Change of Control. (e) Licensee acknowledges its breach of any confidentiality or proprietary rights provision of this Agreement would cause Microchip irreparable damage, for which the award of damages would not be an adequate remedy. Licensee, therefore, agrees if Microchip alleges that Licensee has breached or violated any such provisions then Microchip may seek equitable relief, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity. (f) Authorized representatives of Microchip shall have the right to reasonably inspect Licensee's premises and to audit Licensee's records and inventory of Licensee Products, whether located on Licensee's premises or elsewhere at any time, announced or unannounced, and in its sole and absolute discretion, in order to ensure Licensee's adherence to the terms of this Agreement. (g) Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Software is being licensed to U.S. Government end users (i) only as Commercial Items, and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Microchip licenses. To the extent the Software (or a portion thereof) qualifies as 'technical data' as such term is defined in 48 C.F.R. §252.227-7015(a)(5), then its use, duplication, or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of the Rights in Technical Data clause at 48 C.F.R. §252.227-7015.

    "content": "This example application shows how to use the cache maintenance APIs to avoid issues related to cache coherency when the data cache is enabled. Application uses USART and the DMA PLIBs to demonstrate cache maintenance APIs provided by the Cache peripheral library. Applcation registers a callback with the DMA transmit and receive channels. It then transmits a message using the DMA transmit channel and then schedules a read of ten characters using the DMA receive channel. Once the DMA readis complete, it reads the received data and echoes the same on the terminal using the DMA transmit channel. Application calls DCACHE_CLEAN_BY_ADDR API on the write buffer before transmitting it. Calling this API copies the data from the cache memory to the main memory, thereby ensuring that the DMA peripheral uses the updated values in the write buffer. Application calls the DCACHE_INVALIDATE_BY_ADDR API on the read buffer after reception of data is complete by the DMA receive channel. Calling this API invalidates the cache region corresponding to the read buffer, thereby ensuring that the CPU reads updated values in the main memory into the read buffer (and into the cache memory). Cache maintenance operations are always performed on a cache line (1 cache line = 32 bytes), thus the read and write buffers must be aligned to a 32 byte boundary and must be a multiple of 32 bytes. This is the reason why 32 byte buffers are used for receiving and echoing 10 bytes of data. ",

The buffers are aligned to cache line and its size is an integer multiple of the cache line size. Cache line(s) for source buffer range is cleaned before submitting a transfer request to DMA to load the latest data in the cache to the RAM (DDR). Cache line(s) for destination buffer address range is invalidated to ensure that the CPU reads the latest data from the RAM (DDR). ",

    "content": "This example uses the FLEXCOM TWI peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. There are two pages each of size 256 bytes. FLEXCOM TWI slave expects two bytes of memory address from the FLEXCOM TWI master and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. FLEXCOM TWI slave application supports following: . Byte Write: The FLEXCOM TWI master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of memory address. The slave provides the data present at the requested memory address. Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the FLEXCOM TWI master can write up-to 256 bytes (1 page). If more than 256 bytes are sent by the FLEXCOM TWI master to the FLEXCOM TWI slave, the memory address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. Current Address Read: The internal memory address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. Once the device address with the read/write bit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the data byte at the current address is serially clocked out. After reading the data from the current address, the FLEXCOM TWI master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Random Read: The FLEXCOM TWI master writes the 2 byte memory address and then reads the data from that memory address. After reading the data, the FLEXCOM TWI master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Sequential Read: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the memory address and serially clock out sequential data bytes. When the memory address limit is reached (0x1FF), the memory address will “roll over” to 0x00 and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the FLEXCOM TWI master sends a NAK and generates a STOP condition. To run the application, two evaluation kits will be required - one acting as the FLEXCOM TWI master and the other as the FLEXCOM TWI slave. The FLEXCOM TWI master application to be used for this demo application is available under apps/flexcom/twi/master/flexcom_twi_eeprom/firmware folder. FLEXCOM TWI master writes an array of values to the FLEXCOM TWI slave and verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written. ",

The TX line of FLEXCOM0 is connected to the RX line of FLEXCOM1. The RTS line of FLEXCOM1 is connected to the CTS line of FLEXCOM0. FLEXCOM0 transmits 100 characters using interrupts. Application however simulates a slow receiver by inserting a delay after each character is read on FLEXCOM1. As a result, once the RX FIFO is full, the RTS line is de-asserted and transmitter (FLEXCOM0) stops sending the data. Eventually, when the receiver reads out sufficient number of bytes from the RX FIFO, such that the number of bytes in the FIFO goes below RXFTHRES2, the RTS line is again asserted and the transmitter continues sending the data. The demo application indicates success if the received data matches the transmitted data. ",

If the received data is same as transmitted then it transmits 0 bytes and receives 10 bytes. In this case, dummy data will be transmitted to receive 10 characters, hence all the received data should be 0xFF. Next, 10 bytes are transmitted and 5 bytes are received. Here, the received bytes must match the first 5 bytes in the transmit buffer. Finally, 5 bytes are transmitted and 10 bytes are received. In this case, the first 5 bytes in the receive buffer must match the first 5 bytes in the transmit buffer. The remaining 5 bytes in the receive buffer must be 0xFF. ",

    "content": "This example uses the TWIHS peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. There are two pages each of size 256 bytes. TWIHS slave expects two bytes of memory address from the TWIHS master and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. TWIHS slave application supports following: . Byte Write: The TWIHS master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of memory address. The slave provides the data present at the requested memory address. Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the TWIHS master can write up-to 256 bytes (1 page). If more than 256 bytes are sent by the TWIHS master to the TWIHS slave, the memory address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. Current Address Read: The internal memory address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. Once the device address with the read/write bit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the data byte at the current address is serially clocked out. After reading the data from the current address, the TWIHS master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Random Read: The TWIHS master writes the 2 byte memory address and then reads the data from that memory address. After reading the data, the TWIHS master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Sequential Read: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the memory address and serially clock out sequential data bytes. When the memory address limit is reached (0x1FF), the memory address will “roll over” to 0x00 and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the TWIHS master sends a NAK and generates a STOP condition. To run the application, two evaluation kits will be required - one acting as the TWIHS master and the other as the TWIHS slave. The TWIHS master application to be used for this demo application is available under apps/twihs/master/twihs_eeprom/firmware folder. TWIHS master writes an array of values to the TWIHS slave and verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written. ",
