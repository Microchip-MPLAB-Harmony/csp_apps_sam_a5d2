# Using AT91Boostrap Loader with Harmony 3 MPU Applications

MPU harmony3 applications are compiled and linked to execute from external DRAM memory<br /> that is available on the corresponding evaluation kit. This require all peripherals and<br /> clock leading to the DRAM memory to be configured prior to the application being<br /> programmed into DRAM. This is achieved using a bootstrap loader. We use [AT91bootstrap](https://github.com/linux4sam/at91bootstrap) loader for this purpose.

We have deployed the following pre-built bootstrap binaries inside our application<br /> repositories. They can be found under deps folder at the root of the repository.

|Binary Name|Description|
|-----------|-----------|
|at91bootstrap.elf|Bootstrap which allows debug or run<br /> application using MPLABx|
|boot.bin|Bootstrap which allows booting<br /> application using an SD Card|

To use at91boostrap to load and run harmony applications from MPLABx, it should be build<br /> with **bkpt\_none\_defconfig** configuration. If you are interested in building<br /> at91bootstrap using MPLABx, you can read about it [here](GUID-610BD9E4-8CFE-4D10-BE3A-618B04D516CF.md).

## Configure a Debug Tool

-   Open the MPLABx application that you want to debug or run in MPLABx.
-   Right click on the application project and select properties. This will open the properties window. In the configuration option â€“\> connected hardware tools, select the debugger.

    **Note:** *If no debugger is connected, click on the __show all__ check box and select the supported debugger.*

-   Select the target toolchain and click on apply to save the changes
-   This will result in an additional menu option to be available in the configuration tree view called **bootstrap** as shown below:

## Configure a Bootstrap

-   Click on **Use bootstrap** check box to enable bootstrap support
-   Click on the **LOAD** button to load the bootstrap file. This will open a file picker, which allows you to choose the bootstrap binary file.
-   Navigate to the \{repository root\}/deps/\{board name\}/at91bootstrap\_binaries folder as explained in the previous section. You should choose **at91bootstrap.elf** file \(The **Bootstrap entry address** and the **Bootstrap load address** text box can be left empty as this information will be read from the ELF file automatically\)

## Run/Debug MPU Applications Using MPLABx

You can now Run/Debug the MPU application just like any other MPLABx applications.<br /> When executed, MPLABx performs a two stage loading:

**Stage 1:** Loads the bootstrap loader into the internal SRAM and executes it.<br /> This will configure the board specific peripherals and memory

**Stage 2:** Loads the application into the external DRAM and debugs it. User can<br /> perform actions like setting breakpoints, single-stepping etc.

When using MPLABx to debug a harmony application, you will face the following<br /> limitations:

-   Call stack is not fully supported yet, hence stepping in and out of functions may not work correctly.

## Boot to Application Using SD Card

Copy both the application binary named **harmony.bin** and the bootstrap binary<br /> named **boot.bin** onto an SD card. Insert the SD card into the SD slot of the<br /> evaluation kit and press the reset button.

The ROM bootloader will copy the bootstrap binary **boot.bin** into the internal<br /> SRAM and executes it. The bootstrap will configure the external DRAM and the<br /> required peripherals, then copy the application binary **harmony.bin** into the<br /> DRAM and executes it.
