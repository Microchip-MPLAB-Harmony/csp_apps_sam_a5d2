# FLEXCOM USART Ring Buffer

This example application shows how to use the FLEXCOM peripheral in USART ring buffer<br /> mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example demonstrates read and write over USART using the ring buffer mode. The<br /> USART is configured in non-blocking mode \(interrupts enabled\). The example asks the<br /> user to enter 10 characters. Once received, the characters are echoed back. In the<br /> process, the example demonstrates various ring buffer APIs.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to SAM A5D29 Curiosity board as per below Pin Connections

    |SAM A5D29 Curiosity<br /> board Pins|[USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) Pins|
    |--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    |PIN 5, J8<br /> connector|RX|
    |PIN 4, J8<br /> connector|TX|
    |PIN 7, mikroBUS1<br /> connector|3.3V|
    |PIN 1, J8<br /> connector|GND|

-   Connect the Mini USB connector on the [USB UART click board](http://www.mikroe.com/usb-uart-click) to the computer using a Mini USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  The console displays the following message

    ![](GUID-B0AAA2D9-4679-4704-82F0-C01755DEEF15-low.png)

    -   Console displays the initial transmit and receive buffer sizes
    -   It then adds 10 characters - â€œ0123456789â€? to the transmit buffer and displays the available free space in the transmit buffer after the 10 characters have been added
    -   The message asks the user to enter 10 characters

        **Note:** *For this example, the â€œFree Space in Transmit Buffer = xxâ€?, where xx can be anything between 117 to 127, depending on the USART baud rate and the CPU execution speed.*

5.  Enter 10 characters on the terminal
6.  Entered characters are echoed back on the console and message is displayed indicating that the receive notification is turned on
