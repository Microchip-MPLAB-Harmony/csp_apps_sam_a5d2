# MCAN FD Interrupt

This example application shows how to use the MCAN module to transmit and receive CAN FD<br /> messages in interrupt mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This application transmits and receives CAN FD messages on the CAN bus. To run this<br /> application, two evaluation boards of same type are required. These boards acts as<br /> different nodes on the CAN bus. Same application is programmed onto both the boards.<br /> Boards are connected to PC via UART. While running the application, user can send<br /> and receive CAN FD messages between the boards using UART console applications<br /> running on the PC.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

-   Connect [ATA6563 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/ata6563-click) to each other using DB9 serial cable
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the boards to the computer using a Type-C USB cables
-   Connect the UART Debug port on the board to the computer using a FTDI to USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  In the console associated with board 1, press â€œ0â€? to transmit a CAN FD message
5.  Transmitted message description and status will be displayed in the console window of board 1
6.  Received message will be displayed in the console window of board 2
7.  Follow the sequence below to send and receive different messages:
    -   Press â€˜1â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜2â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜3â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜4â€™ on board 1
    -   Press â€˜0â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜1â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜2â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜3â€™ on board 2
    -   Press â€˜4â€™ on board 2
8.  If the steps are executed in this sequence, the final output in the consoles will be as below \(console on the left is the transmitter \(board 1\) and the one on the right is receiver \(board 2\)\):
