# USART Ring Buffer

This example application shows how to use USART peripheral in ring buffer mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example demonstrates read and write over USART using the ring buffer mode. The<br /> USART is configured in non-blocking mode \(interrupts enabled\). The example asks the<br /> user to enter 10 characters. Once received, the characters are echoed back. In the<br /> process, the example demonstrates various ring buffer APIs.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board Kit

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect UART Debug port on the board to the computer using a FTDI USB cable
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable.

### Setting Up SAMA5D27-SOM1-EK1

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connecting a micro-USB cable to J10 both powers the board as well as provides a virtual COM port to open a serial terminal

### Setting Up ATSAMA5D27-WLSOM1 Evaluation Kit

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect a USB to UART FTDI cable to J26 \(DEBUG FTDI\) to open a serial terminal
-   Connecting a micro-USB cable to J10 powers the board
-   Press the SW3 \(nSTART\_SOM\) button to power the ATSAMA5D27-WLSOM1 System-On-Module

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  The console displays the following message

    ![](GUID-72E4E2A7-EA8B-46DE-950B-353F62BD2B08-low.png)

    -   The console displays the initial transmit and receive buffer sizes
    -   It then adds 10 characters - â€œ0123456789â€? to the transmit buffer and displays the available free space in the transmit buffer after the 10 characters have been added
    -   The message asks the user to enter 10 characters

        **Note:** *For this example, the â€œFree Space in Transmit Buffer = xxâ€?, where xx can be anything between 117 to 127, depending on the USART baud rate and the CPU execution speed.*

5.  Enter 10 characters on the terminal
6.  Entered characters are echoed back on the console and message is displayed indicating that the receive notification is turned on

7.  For every 10 characters typed, it will be echoed back on the console
