# SPI Blocking

This example application shows how to use the SPI peripheral to transmit and receive a<br /> block of data in a blocking manner.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example demonstrates transmit and receive operation over SPI interface in a<br /> blocking manner. It transmits known values from an array and verifies the data<br /> received through loop back by comparing both. The example application performs the<br /> loop back test only once after a power on reset. After the loop back is complete,<br /> the status of the loop back is indicated and the application remains idle. The loop<br /> back test requires the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that<br /> anything transmitted will also be received.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Use a jumper wire to short pin 5 and pin 6 of the mikroBUS1 connector

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   The LED is turned ON when the value read matched with the written value
    -   The LED is turned OFF when the value read did not match with the written value

Refer to the following table for LED name:
