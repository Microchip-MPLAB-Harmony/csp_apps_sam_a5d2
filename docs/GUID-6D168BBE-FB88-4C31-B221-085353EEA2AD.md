# RSTC Interrupt

This example application shows how to use the RSTC peripheral to generate an interrupt<br /> instead of generating a reset, when the Reset switch is pressed on board.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

The RSTC peripheral samples the Reset input \(NRST pin\) at slow clock speed. When the<br /> line is detected low, it resets the processor and the peripherals. However, the RSTC<br /> peripheral can be programmed to not trigger a reset when an assertion of NRST<br /> occurs. The Reset pin state can be read at any time in software or it can also be<br /> programmed to generate an interrupt instead of generating a reset.

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDITIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   SD Card with FAT32 file system

**SETTING UP THE SD CARD**

-   Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader
-   Copy the downloaded boot loader binary\( boot.bin\) onto the SD card

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   SDMMC slot used for bootloading the application is SDMMC0
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Copy the output binary \(named â€˜harmony.binâ€™\) onto the SD Card \(Refer to the â€˜Setting up hardwareâ€™ section above for setting up the SD card\)
3.  Insert the SD card into SDMMC slot on the board \(Refer to the â€˜Setting up hardwareâ€™ section for the correct SDMMC slot\)
4.  Disconnect and reconnect the Debug USB port to power cycle the board
5.  Press the â€œRESETâ€? switch and observe the LED toggling

    **Note:** *Push and release RESET switch very quickly so as to not end up cutting power to the PMIC triggering a power on reset \(instead of just toggling of the reset pin\).*
