# PWM Synchronous Channels

This example application shows how to use the PWM peripheral to generate 3-phase PWM<br /> signals with dead time.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This example shows how to configure the PWM to generate synchronous 3-phase PWM<br /> signals with dead time \(used for motor control\). The duty cycle of the PWM is<br /> updated in the interrupt handler.

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its<br /> IDE.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_a5d2\_curiosity.X|MPLABX project for [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect PB0 \(PIN 16 of mikroBUS2 \(J22\)\) to an an oscilloscope/Logic analyzer

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Observe the high-side PWM waveform on the oscilloscope
3.  PWM frequency is 20 kHz
4.  Duty cycle varies from 0 to 100 %

Refer to the below table for PWM output pins for different boards:
