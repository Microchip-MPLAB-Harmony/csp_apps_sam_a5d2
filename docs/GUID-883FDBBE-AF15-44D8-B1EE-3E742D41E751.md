# XDMAC Memory Transfer

This example application shows how to use the XDMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory<br /> transfer and illustrates the usage of burst size to reduce the transfer time.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

The application uses the XDMAC peripheral to transfer data from source buffer to<br /> destination buffer with burst sizes of 1 and 16. The number of cycles taken for the<br /> transfer is measured using the Periodic Interval Timer \(PIT\) to illustrate how the<br /> burst size helps to reduces the transfer time.

This example also demonstrates cache maintenance operation by cleaning and<br /> invalidating cache for the buffers located in cacheable memory. The buffers are<br /> aligned to cache line and its size is an integer multiple of the cache line size.<br /> Cache line\(s\) for source buffer range is cleaned before submitting a transfer<br /> request to DMA to load the latest data in the cache to the RAM \(DDR\). Cache line\(s\)<br /> for destination buffer address range is invalidated to ensure that the CPU reads the<br /> latest data from the RAM \(DDR\).

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect the UART Debug port on the board to the computer using a FTDI to USB cable

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the EDBG/Jlink Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  See the following message in the console
