# FLEXCOM TWI \(I2C\) EEPROM

This example application shows how to use the FLEXCOM module in TWI mode.

**Parent topic:**[Harmony 3 Peripheral Library Application Examples for SAMA5D2 Family](GUID-3730E5D6-911C-4BCA-9955-26D7EB66B585.md)

## Description

This application configures the FLEXCOM peripheral in TWI mode to read and write data<br /> from an external EEPROM memory chip. Data is written to the EEPROM and then read<br /> back and compared. Successful comparison is indicated by turning on an LED.

## Downloading and Building the Application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_a5d2) and then<br /> click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file. This content<br /> can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is<br /> **apps/flexcom/twi/master/flexcom\_twi\_eeprom/firmware**.

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its<br /> IDE.

|Project Name|Description|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**ADDITIONAL HARDWARE REQUIRED**

-   [EEPROM 3 click Board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-3-click)

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect EEPROM Click 3 Board to RPi 40-pin GPIO \(J25\) connector on the board as per below Pin Connections table

    |XPRO EXT2 \(J26\)<br /> Pins|EEPROM 4 CLICK<br /> Pins|
    |------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    |PIN 19|SDA|
    |PIN 21|SCL|
    |PIN 17|3V3|
    |PIN 39|GND|


## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  LED indicates the success or failure:
    -   LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    -   LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:
