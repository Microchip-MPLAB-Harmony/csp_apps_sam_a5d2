# Clock Configuration

This example application shows how to configure the clock system to run the device at<br /> maximum frequency. It also outputs a prescaled clock signal on a GPIO pin for<br /> measurement and verification.

## Description

Clock system generates and distributes the clock for the processor and peripherals.<br /> This example application shows how to use the clock manager to configure the device<br /> to run at the max possible speed. A prescaled clock signal is routed to GPIO pin to<br /> measure the frequency and accuracy of the internal device clock.

## Downloading and Building the Application

Path of the application within the repository is<br /> **apps/clock/clock\_config/firmware**.

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its<br /> IDE.

|Project Name|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|sam\_a5d2\_curiosity.X|MPLABX project for [SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|

## Setting Up AT91Bootstrap Loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap<br /> loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](GUID-DA6B998E-C5DD-4566-BB08-7DC124553FBF.md) for<br /> details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to<br /> bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting Up the Hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable
-   Connect an oscilloscope to monitor the PORT pin PD6 \(Pin \#11 on the 40-pin GPIO Connector \(J25\)\)

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Observe the clock of ~4.15 MHz on clock output pin
3.  LED should be blinking continuously

Refer to the following table for clock output pin and LED name for different<br /> boards:

|Board|Clock Output Pin|LED Name|
|-----|----------------|--------|
|[SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV07R15A)|PD6 \(Pin \#11 on on the 40-pin<br /> GPIO Connector \(J25\)\)|RGB\_LED \(Blue\)|
