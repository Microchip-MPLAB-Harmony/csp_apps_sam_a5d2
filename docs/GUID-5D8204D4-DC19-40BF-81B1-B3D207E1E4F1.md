### Setting Up SAMA5D29 Curiosity Development Board

**SETTING UP THE BOARD**

-   Connect the UART Debug port \(J28\) on the board to the computer using a FTDI USB to serial cable. \(to enable debug com port\)
-   Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a Type-C USB cable \(to power the board\)

## Running the Application

1.  Build the application using its IDE
2.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera term\) on the computer.
3.  Connect to the Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 115200
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
4.  Press â€˜0â€™ in the terminal window
    -   Observe the message â€œEntering Idle Mode for 30 secondsâ€? in the terminal window
    -   Wait for 30 seconds and observe the message â€œLeaving Idle Modeâ€? in the terminal window
5.  Press â€˜1â€™ in the terminal window
    -   Observe the message â€œEntering ULP0 Mode for 30 secondsâ€? in the terminal window
    -   Wait for 30 seconds and observe the message â€œLeaving ULP0 Modeâ€? in the terminal window.
